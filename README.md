# Infinite Double Panda
## Overview
Based on the original [Double Panda](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-double-panda "Double Panda") game, this single-player game is one endless level that features random smart “terrain” generation, enemy AI that increases game difficulty, and an attractive user interface. Users make a username that allows them to save their progress / game state and high score.

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by eating candy and killing enemies.

All graphics and images are either derived from (and edited on GIMP) or directly captured from the original game at the link cited above.

This project was my Fall 2020 15-112 term project.

## Required Libraries
Pygame, SQLite3
## To Run
Open main.py and run.
## Useful Shortcuts
* Press 'h' for instructions screen.
* Press 's' to add 10000 to the score. This is useful for testing the code since different parts of the game get harder/more complex as the score increases. (For example: enemy generation, ArcherEnemy will shoot based on the direction you are traveling in, and BasicEnemy will walk towards main player on the same platform.)
* Press 'q' to quit the game and save your game data.
