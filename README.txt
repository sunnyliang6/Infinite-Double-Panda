Project Name: Infinite Double Panda

Description: Based on the original Double Panda (found at 
https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-double-panda), this single-player game is 
one endless level featuring random platform generation and enemy AI. 
The goal is to control the two pandas to score as many points as possible by 
eating candy and killing enemies. 

How to run: Open main.py and run. 

Libraries: PIL/Pillow, Requests, cmu_112_graphics

Shortcuts: 
- Press 'h' for instructions screen. 
- Press 's' to change the score to 10000. This is most useful for testing the 
code since different parts of the game get harder/more complex as the score 
increases. (For example: enemy generation, archer enemy will shoot based on 
the direction you are traveling in, basic enemy will walk towards main player 
on the same platform)
